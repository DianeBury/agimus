### Installation procedure

The easiest to install the Agimus framework is to use `doc/Makefile`.

```bash
wget -O Makefile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agimus/agimus/master/doc/Makefile
# Edit Makefile (set SRC_DIR and INSTALL_DIR)
make bootstrap
make all
# Eventually
make agimus-demos.install
```
